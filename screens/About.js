        This study aims to design an IOT-based charge controller that can
        remotely monitor the status of batteries and solar panels using
        Raspberry Pi, and to develop an Android application that can receive
        real-time data from the solar charge controller.

        1. To propose a design for the solar charge controller and Android
        application enabled by IoT using Raspberry Pi. {"\n"}2. Consider both
        overcharging and over-discharging to determine the reliability of the
        battery's protection system. {"\n"}3. Consider both manual and remote
        switching control to determine the reliability of the device's switching
        control function on the terminals. {"\n"}4. To determine the android
        application's accuracy in monitoring the charging process in terms of
        voltage and current.{"\n"}5. To determine the general acceptability of
        the IoT-Based Solar Charge Controller and Android Application using
        Raspberry Pi based on ISO/IEC 25010 â€“ Software Product Quality Standards
        in terms of Functional Suitability, Compatibility, Usability,
        Reliability, Security, and Portability.
